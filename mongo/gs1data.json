If hair is longer, trim it with scissors before you wax to avoid discomfort and damage to the skin when waxing.\r\n12. Before use makes sure your skin is dry, non- irritated, and free of creams, oils or deodorant.\r\n13. Before every use, TEST YOUR SKIN REACTION by applying and removing the product to a small part of the area you wish to treat, following the directions for use. If after 24 HOURS there is no adverse reaction, continue to use."},"direction":{"direction":"1. Ensure skin is dry before you apply strips. Apply one strip onto skin and smooth firmly with your hands for 5 seconds in the direction of hair growth (depending on the body part, please refer to the appropriate section below or in the package's leaflet).\r\n2. Holding the EasyGrip tab, pull the strip back on itself against the direction your hair grows very quickly and in 1 swift motion, keeping the strip as close to the skin as possible. Failure to do so may be painful, and waxing will be less effective. To relieve discomfort, apply pressure on your skin with your hands (optional).\r\n3. The same strip can be used several times. To re-use, fold strip and warm between your hands. Repeat steps above.\r\n4. Once all hair has been removed, gently wipe the skin with a Perfect Finish Wipe to remove any remaining wax residue. Never use water, soap or alcohol to wipe away any traces of wax. If needed, use cotton wool soaked with oil."},"ingredients":{"ingredients":"Triethylene Glycol Rosinate, Glyceryl Rosinate, Silica, Polyethylene, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Parfum, Paraffinum Liquidum, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, CI 77891, CI 15850"},"storage_condition":{"storage_condition":""}},"brand":"VEET","case_configuration":"","category":"Personal Care","company_detail":{"address":{"address1":"ENKAY CENTER, IIND FLOOR,VANIJYA NIKUNJ, UDYOG VIHAR,PHASE-V,","address2":"IIND FLOOR,VANIJYA NIKUNJ,","address3":"UDYOG VIHAR,PHASE-V,","city":"Gurgaon","pincode":"122106","state":"Haryana"},"contact_info":{"contact_person":"Mr Manish Dawar","email":"MANISH.DAWAR@RECKITTBENCKISER.COM","fax":"","telephone":"","website":"WWW.RECKITTBENCKISER.COM"},"gcp":"8901396","name":"RECKITT BENCKISER (INDIA)  LTD."},"description":"Veet Full Body Waxing Kit Normal Skin.\r\nBox Contents:\r\n20 (10*2) Re-usable,Ready-to-Use Wax Strips\r\n5 Perfect Finish Wipes\r\n1 Leaflet","dimensions":{"depth":"25.77","height":"185.87","measurement_unit":"MM","packaging_level":"Primary","width":"81.13"},"flag":false,"gross_weight":"","gtin":"8901396362500","images":{"back":"https://gs1datakart.org/upload/product_image/8901396/8901396362500/8901396362500_b.jpg","bottom":"https://gs1datakart.org/upload/product_image/8901396/8901396362500/8901396362500_bo.jpg","front":"https://gs1datakart.org/upload/product_image/8901396/8901396362500/8901396362500_f.jpg","left":"https://gs1datakart.org/upload/product_image/8901396/8901396362500/8901396362500_l.jpg","right":"","top":"https://gs1datakart.org/upload/product_image/8901396/8901396362500/8901396362500_t.jpg","top_left":"","top_right":""},"mrp_info":[{"currency_id":"107","currency_title":"Rupees","mrp":"150","mrp_activation_date":"2016-02-18","mrp_location":"166","product_id":"7379","product_mrp_sequence_id":"15309","state_name":"Pan India"}],"name":"Full Body Waxing Kit Normal Skin","net_weight":"","sub_category":"Skin Care","url":"","weight_measurement_unit":"Other"}
